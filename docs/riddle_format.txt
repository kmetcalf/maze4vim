Riddles
When a player steps onto a trap, the system presents a riddle to the user.  If the user does not answer correctly, they cannot escape the trap.

Filenames:
All riddles are stored in the "riddles/" folder.  The file naming convention tells you what maze level these riddles are associated with.

e.g., "riddles/level1" may be used in maze levels 1 and above.

File Format:
Riddle files consist of an even number of lines.  Each pair of lines is a question and answer pair.

e.g.:
q: Which key lets you navigate left in the maze?
a: h
q: Which key lets you navigate right in the maze?
a: l

In this example, we have two questions.  Note the question begins with q: and the answer begins with a:.  You can add your own questions by just updating these files.
